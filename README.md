# 🧠 Language Identification using Naive Bayes

This project focuses on building a **Machine Learning model** that can automatically **detect the language** of a given text input using the **Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm**.  
It performs **data preprocessing, feature extraction, visualization, and evaluation** to achieve accurate and interpretable language predictions.

## 🌟 Project Overview

In a multilingual world, identifying the language of text is crucial for applications like translation, speech recognition, and content filtering.  
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Naive Bayes classification** to categorize text into different languages such as English, Hindi, French, Spanish, and more.

The model learns from a labeled dataset containing sample sentences in various languages, extracts textual features, and predicts the language of unseen data with high accuracy.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To develop an accurate **language classification model** using Naive Bayes  
- To perform **data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering**  
- To visualize dataset characteristics using **matplotlib and seaborn**  
- To evaluate performance using **accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics**

## 🧩 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - CSV dataset containing text samples and their language labels  
   - Example columns: `Text`, `Language`

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal)  
   - Handling missing or duplicate entries  

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Convert text to numerical features using **CountVectorizer** or **TF-IDF Vectorizer**  

4. **Model Training**  
   - Use **Multinomial Naive Bayes** to train on the dataset  
   - Evaluate with accuracy score and confusion matrix  

5. **Model Evaluation & Visualization**  
   - Visualize data distributions and confusion matrix  
   - Display model accuracy and performance metrics  

6. **Prediction**  
   - Input a new sentence → Model predicts its language
